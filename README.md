- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielwiet
- 👀 🌱I'm new to coding. I am primarily focusing on Python and SQL for data science applications, and some HTML/CSS/Javascript to round things out
- 💞️ I’m trying to get as much experience collaborating on anything that I can, so if you have something trivial or mundane that you a). you don't want to do yourself
  and b). don't need immediately, I'd love to help out
- 📫 You can reach me at danwiet@gmail.com

hmu if you want to create something!
